description: "STAGE 5 (confidence gate) — dry-run the current plan against the target Kissflow account WITHOUT applying: validate the IR, show exactly what would be created (apps/flows/forms/fields/workflows/permissions/pages) and flag anything risky or immutable. This is the \"are we confident?\" checkpoint before /author-generate."
argument-hint: (operates on runs/current; nothing is created)

**Stage 5: preview.** The last look before build. Published Kissflow processes are **immutable over
REST** — you can't PUT or DELETE them afterwards — so this stage exists to make the team *confident*
the plan is right, not just valid.

Pre-req: a current run with a verified `runs/current/app-spec.json`.

## Do
1. **Validate hard** — `node engine/cli.mjs verify runs/current/app-spec.json`. Any error stops here.
2. **Dry-run the build** — `node engine/cli.mjs build runs/current/app-spec.json --out runs/current/preview`
   compiles the IR into metadata blobs WITHOUT calling Kissflow (writes the plan to `preview/`). Read it
   and print the **build manifest**: N apps, flows (by type), forms, fields (with formulas/aggregates/
   lookups), workflow steps, permission grants, pages/nav.
3. **Flag the irreversibles** — call out every Process/Case that, once generated, can't be changed via
   REST; and anything that would REUSE vs CREATE if re-run.
4. **Cross-check open questions** — if `runs/current/open-questions.md` still has unresolved items that
   affect the build, list them: "resolve or accept before generating."
5. Do NOT snapshot (preview mutates nothing) and do NOT call Kissflow.

## Output
The build manifest + an explicit **confidence checklist**: ✅ verified, the immutable items, unresolved
questions, and reuse-vs-create behaviour. End with the gate: *"If this looks right, `/author-generate`
to build it in dev. Otherwise `/author-refine \"…\"`."*

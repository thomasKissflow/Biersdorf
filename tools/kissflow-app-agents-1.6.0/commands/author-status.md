description: "Show the current run's state — stage, target, whether it's been generated, and the version ladder (v1, v2, …) with each snapshot's change note. Read-only."
argument-hint: (operates on runs/current)
---

Show where the current authoring run stands.

## Do
1. `node engine/runs.mjs status` — prints `RUN.md` (stage, target, generated?, version list with notes).
2. Read `runs/current/open-questions.md` (if present) and surface any still-unresolved questions.
3. Glance at `runs/current/decisions.md` and report the count + how many are `proposed` vs
   `changed-by-user`.

## Output
A compact status card: **run name · stage · target · generated? · N versions** (latest note),
unresolved-question count, decision count. Then the single most useful next command for this stage
(`/author-plan`, `/author-review`, `/author-refine`, `/author-preview`, or `/author-generate`).

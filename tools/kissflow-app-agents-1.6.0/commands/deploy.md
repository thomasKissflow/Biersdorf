Build the app UI and package it for Kissflow.

Workflow — ask the target first:

0. Ask the user (AskUserQuestion) where to deploy:
   - **Dev** — point the app's Custom UI at the running dev server URL (fast iteration;
     live data via the proxy). No upload needed — they paste the dev URL in Kissflow.
   - **Prod** — build + zip the static bundle and upload it to the app's Custom UI
     (self-contained, no dev server). Use this for a real release.
   Carry the choice through the steps below.

Steps:

1. **Dev target** → don't zip. Make sure the dev server is running (`/run`, `https://localhost:3000`),
   then enable Custom UI against it and open the app in one shot:
   ```bash
   node engine/cli.mjs deploy-ui --app <appId> --url https://localhost:3000 --open
   ```
   This points the app's Custom UI at the dev server, sets `_is_custom_ui_enabled`, and (`--open`)
   launches the app in the default browser. Skip to step 3.

   **Prod target** → build + zip:
   ```bash
   npm run zip
   ```
   This runs the production build and produces `<your-project>.zip`
   (the `dist/` bundle + a `manifest.json` of `{ Category: "Page", Framework: "React" }`).
   If the build fails, fix the errors and re-run before continuing.

   Then upload it programmatically — the zip path is fully wired (proven live on real
   deployments — upload → ingest-validate → publish → flag):
   ```bash
   node engine/cli.mjs deploy-ui <path/to/ui.zip> --app <appId>
   ```
   The zip must contain the CONTENTS of `dist/` at its root (`cd dist && zip -qr ../ui.zip .`).
   Manual upload (step 2) remains the fallback if the API path fails. Note `--url` mode's iframe
   caveat: the dev server's self-signed cert makes Kissflow's iframe render a blank "temporarily
   down" page until the user visits the localhost URL once and accepts the cert.

2. Tell the user how to publish (this part is manual — Kissflow has no publish API):
   - In the Kissflow App Builder for the connected app → **Settings → Custom UI**.
   - **Prod**: upload the generated `<your-project>.zip`. **Dev**: set the dev-server URL.
   - Open the app inside Kissflow. Now it runs in the Kissflow iframe → the **real SDK**
     initializes → native forms (`openForm`), validations, field permissions, and
     drag-drop stage changes all work for real.

3. Remind them: anything that was a dev-only preview on localhost (native forms,
   stage-changing drag-drop) becomes fully functional once running inside Kissflow.

Re-run `/deploy` after each change to repackage; the Custom UI just stores the bundle.
